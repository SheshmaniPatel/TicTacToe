# TicTacToe
A project using JAVA

# For marking your symbol on the position you want use array index method.
Its a 3 X 3 box game .
so for going into x or y axis you have to start your count from 0 and next path is given by a space

# EXAMPLE
For going in the third box of 1st row (0 2)
For going in 3rd box of row three (2 2)

# Thanks
